To-Do:
- Custom IP to do WAN check against (to remove need for 8.8.8.8 for those who block google)
- automatically unmonitor slot after X failed connections?
- Possibility: Integrate KILLMON functionality if there is any interest in having better killswitch capabilities
- Wireguard compatibility
- Failover capability from slot 1, to 2 etc.
- If the WAN doesn't respond after X minutes, issue a router reboot?

Done:
- AMTM Email notifications on: WAN Restore, VPN Reconnections
- Skynet whitelist your vpn ip server lists
- ping reset > ms
- add ip address/host to log when it disconnects
- method: Get to usable operations menu before wan/vpn checks
- Monitoring for WAN drops/outages as in R2
- Automate running of custom CURL statements under server list automation using CRON
- Create a separate thread with CURL examples for all R2-supported VPN providers
- Add ping values to main UI
- Build a VPN Server List builder that exports IPs into a certain Client Slot txt file
- Consider building Unbound tie-in
