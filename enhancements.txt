To-Do:
- Integrate KILLMON functionality if there is any interest in having better killswitch capabilities
- Potentially monitoring for WAN drops/outages as in R2

Done:
- Automate running of custom CURL statements under server list automation using CRON
- Create a separate thread with CURL examples for all R2-supported VPN providers
- Add ping values to main UI
- Build a VPN Server List builder that exports IPs into a certain Client Slot txt file
- Consider building Unbound tie-in
