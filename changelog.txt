v1.04b6  - (TBA)
         - ADDED: Under the Run Automations operations menu item, the ability to import your custom VPN Slot lists
           can now be imported into Skynet! In the past, certain blocklists would also prevent you from connecting to
           certain VPN servers because they were actively being blocked. From this menu, pressing s1-s5 will import
           the contents directly to Skynet, giving you peace of mind that your VPN server endpoints are whitelisted.
         - FIXED: The timing on connecting, stopping and settling have been dropped slightly.

v1.04b5  - (January 19, 2024)
         - FIXED: WAN checks were still happening even when disabled. Thanks to @salvo! Fixed!

v1.04b4  - (January 19, 2024)
         - ADDED: More checks while determining vpn health, and adding more logic around failed connections, including
           an indicator showing the number of attempts a certain vpn slot has undergone if it comes back failing the
           ping and curl tests.
         - ADDED: Also, timing delays to allow for tunnels to connect, disconnect and settle have been extended. No,
           your router hasn't slowed down. I'm just making sure processes aren't stepping over each other to give you
           the most stable monitoring experience.
         - ADDED: When a VPN connection fails, an intermediate 5 second counter will appear allowing you to (P}ause
           execution. This allows you to enter the Operations Menu, should you need to make any adjustments. I found
           that with successive failures, it was nearly impossible to get to the Operations menu in order to exclude
           a certain slot that was causing issues.
         - FIXED: When the -reset switch is thrown, VPNMON-R3 will immediately drop to the waiting screen. Thanks to
           @salvo for noticing!

v1.04b2  - (January 13, 2024)
         - MAJOR: In one of the recent storms that brough down my WAN connection, I quickly found out that VPNMON-R3
           does not like that, and caused the script to hang for some unknown reason. Thinking it might be a good idea
           to break out the WAN monitoring functionality from R2, this has now been incorporated as a selectable
           option. When enabled, VPNMON-R3 will test the WAN on each cycle, and if determined that the WAN is down,
           will kill your VPN connections, and fall back into a graceful loop where it periodically tests the WAN 
           connection in order to start the VPN connection(s) back up. As with R2, this will look at both WAN0 and 
           WAN1, and should be able to correctly display the necessary information for those running those fancy
           Dual-WAN configurations. This has been tested on a single WAN0 connection where I completely powered off
           the modem, simulating a WAN outage, and bringing back up to ensure R3 was able to recover correctly.
         - ADDED: Few more log entries for various reset conditions were added.
         - FIXED: Minor corrections to wording or other on-screen layouts to make the UI more pleasing to the eye.
         - FIXED: Made some revisions to how variables were used in order to cut down on some Unknown Operand errors
           that were initially captured by @Ripshod. Thank you!

v1.03    - (January 6, 2024)
         - ADDED: When VPNMON-R3 is executing a scheduled -RESET, the main UI will enter a 'pause' state, giving some
           feedback that a vpn reset is currently underway, and will retry to resume normal operations every 15 secs.
           Thanks to @salvo for the suggestion!
         - ADDED: More checks and stability added to ensuring values returning from the ping functions are valid, and
           hoping to catch any errors before returning the occasional 'unexpected token' error as found by @salvo.
         - FIXED: Noticed that the timer loop was actually taking 2x as long to complete... I knew seconds couldn't
           take that long, and wasn't going crazy afterall. Fixed.

v1.01    - (December 24, 2023)
         - FINAL RELEASE: Merry Christmas! ;)

v0.7b    - ADDED: Now including the total time a VPN connection has remained connected. This info is displayed on the
           main UI next to the exit city name. Time is tracked when the VPN drops and reconnects, and will only be
           displayed for VPN Client Slots that are actively being monitored.
         - MINOR: Changed the Unbound stat on the main UI in an effort to shorten. This has now been changed from a
           Red/Yellow/Green "- [SYNC]", to a Red/Yellow/Green "-X[UB]" "-?[UB]" and "->[UB]" giving an indication of
           the Unbound [UB] sync state.
         - FIXED: There was an issue with the logic behind the function that allowed you to pick how many seconds you
           would like the timer to run for. Apparently it's not so easy when asking for alpha and numeric input up to
           3 characters. Patched it up. Good to go! Thanks to @pchtz for catching this one! :)

v0.6b    - ADDED: New menu item under the setup/configuration menu: "Refresh Custom Server Lists on -RESET Switch",
           with thanks to @salvo for the suggestion. This option will refresh any custom VPN Client Slot Server Lists
           you have defined, and will refresh these when running a VPNMON-R3 with a -reset command. This is typically
           done through a CRON job, but can be run manually at any time as well depending on your needs.
         - FIXED: Various cleanup and inconsistencies as well as spacing here & there...

v0.5b    - ADDED: Created a new row under the Operations Menu to allow you to quickly stop + unmonitor a VPN Slot.
           This was added to give you some more control over a VPN Client Slot that might be giving you trouble, or
           don't want to have to go into the router UI to forcefully stop a VPN Client Slot. Performing this action
           will also remove it from the monitored list, so it doesn't immediately try to reconnect it.
         - ADDED: Created a thread with tutorials and examples on how to craft custom CURL+JQ statements in order to
           query specific city and/or country IP address list from various VPN providers using their APIs. This is
           thread is available here: https://www.snbforums.com/threads/vpnmon-r3-custom-server-list-generation-tutorials-and-examples.88022/
         - FIXED: Added some validation on obtaining the public VPN IP address in case NVRAM could not produce it, and
           icanhazip.com comes back with an error message. Thanks to @TITAN for bringing this up.
         - FIXED: General cleanup of inconsistencies that kept bugging me. ;)

v0.4b    - ADDED: Relented and included a single PING indicator across the VPN tunnel to at least show some stats of
           what's going on with the connection. Formatted to handle 4 digits and 3 decimals, we should be good for the
           worse of worsest situations. On the fence of supporting a > amount ping reset condition.
         - FIXED: Eliminated many script restarts after exiting various menus and allows you to return to the main UI
           without interference to the VPN city and Unbound Sync lookups.
         - FIXED: Based on the timezone code length, the main UI bar now fixes its size so it stays a uniform length.

v0.3b    - ADDED: Brought over the "Unbound-over-VPN" functionality that was originally introduced in VPNMON-R2. Out of
           all the integrations that were present in VPNMON-R2, I felt that this was one of the most important ones, and 
           one that I wanted to be completely functional in VPNMON-R3 if I am going to be using this full-time. Unbound 
           by default allows you to become your own DNS resolver, however, "Unbound-over-VPN" goes a step further and 
           encrypts your unencrypted DNS resolver traffic all the way through to your public VPN IP address, after which 
           it traverses unencrypted to the DNS Root Servers. This excellent feature prevents your ISP or other monitoring
           services from snooping in on your otherwise unencrypted DNS resolver traffic that normally happens when
           running Unbound. Since you are your own encrypted DNS resolver, no ISPs, or other DNS services (like Quad9, 
           Cloudfare or Google, etc) will be able to snoop on your traffic. The only entity here that could possibly 
           snoop on this traffic would be your VPN provider, or any nefarious services monitoring inbound/outbound VPN 
           traffic at the VPN provider level. PLEASE NOTE: "Unbound-over-VPN" is only able to bind to 1 VPN Client Slot. 
           If you are running other VPN connections, this will continue to work, however it is not guaranteed that the 
           other VPN connections will be able to take advantage of Unbound. Definitely something that needs to be tested. 
           Also, if other VPN connections are reset, the VPN Client Slot tied to "Unbound-over-VPN" will go out of sync, 
           and will attempt to reset itself. This connection will always need to be the last one to reset itself, else it 
           will continue to stay out-of-sync.
         - FIXED: Apparently I overlooked making sure JQuery was being properly referenced as required during the setup 
           process. Thanks to @kuki68ster for noticing this! The script will now catch this and guide you through the 
           Entware component install process.
         - FIXED: In certain situations, the autostart functionality would not save a setting back to the vpnmon-r3.cfg 
           file, and show that it was enabled. If you have this issue, simply re-save your choice, and it will make the 
           correct changes to the .cfg file now.

v0.2b    - ADDED: Included "VPN Client Slot Server List Automation" functionality which allows you to free-form enter in
           various carefully crafted CURL statements which are designed to point to your VPN Provider's API functionality
           in order to export out a single list of VPN Server IPs/Hostnames to be imported into your VPN Client Slot 
           Server List files assigned to each VPN slot. These lists are used by VPNMON-R3 to randomly reconnect to one of
           the hosts in the list. A separate thread will be created on SNBForums.com that will give specific examples on
           how to format the CURL statements in order to pull VPN Server IPs for specific countries, or cities. Please
           note that not all VPN providers make this easy, or have an API to pull information from. Examples for NordVPN,
           Surfshark, AirVPN, WeVPN and PerfectPrivacy will be provided. This item is available under the Quick Access
           Operations Menu using the (U) key.
         - MINOR: A few visual fixes here and there to standardize look & feel across screens

v0.1b    - Initial Release!
