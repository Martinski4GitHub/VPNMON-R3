v0.4b    - ADDED: Relented and included a single PING indicator across the VPN tunnel to at least show some stats of
           what's going on with the connection. Formatted to handle 4 digits and 3 decimals, we should be good for the
           worse of worsest situations. On the fence of supporting a > amount ping reset condition.
         - FIXED: Eliminated many script restarts after exiting various menus and allows you to return to the main UI
           without interference to the VPN city and Unbound Sync lookups.
         - FIXED: Based on the timezone code length, the main UI bar now fixes its size so it stays a uniform length.

v0.3b    - ADDED: Brought over the "Unbound-over-VPN" functionality that was originally introduced in VPNMON-R2. Out of
           all the integrations that were present in VPNMON-R2, I felt that this was one of the most important ones, and 
           one that I wanted to be completely functional in VPNMON-R3 if I am going to be using this full-time. Unbound 
           by default allows you to become your own DNS resolver, however, "Unbound-over-VPN" goes a step further and 
           encrypts your unencrypted DNS resolver traffic all the way through to your public VPN IP address, after which 
           it traverses unencrypted to the DNS Root Servers. This excellent feature prevents your ISP or other monitoring
           services from snooping in on your otherwise unencrypted DNS resolver traffic that normally happens when
           running Unbound. Since you are your own encrypted DNS resolver, no ISPs, or other DNS services (like Quad9, 
           Cloudfare or Google, etc) will be able to snoop on your traffic. The only entity here that could possibly 
           snoop on this traffic would be your VPN provider, or any nefarious services monitoring inbound/outbound VPN 
           traffic at the VPN provider level. PLEASE NOTE: "Unbound-over-VPN" is only able to bind to 1 VPN Client Slot. 
           If you are running other VPN connections, this will continue to work, however it is not guaranteed that the 
           other VPN connections will be able to take advantage of Unbound. Definitely something that needs to be tested. 
           Also, if other VPN connections are reset, the VPN Client Slot tied to "Unbound-over-VPN" will go out of sync, 
           and will attempt to reset itself. This connection will always need to be the last one to reset itself, else it 
           will continue to stay out-of-sync.
         - FIXED: Apparently I overlooked making sure JQuery was being properly referenced as required during the setup 
           process. Thanks to @kuki68ster for noticing this! The script will now catch this and guide you through the 
           Entware component install process.
         - FIXED: In certain situations, the autostart functionality would not save a setting back to the vpnmon-r3.cfg 
           file, and show that it was enabled. If you have this issue, simply re-save your choice, and it will make the 
           correct changes to the .cfg file now.

v0.2b    - ADDED: Included "VPN Client Slot Server List Automation" functionality which allows you to free-form enter in
           various carefully crafted CURL statements which are designed to point to your VPN Provider's API functionality
           in order to export out a single list of VPN Server IPs/Hostnames to be imported into your VPN Client Slot 
           Server List files assigned to each VPN slot. These lists are used by VPNMON-R3 to randomly reconnect to one of
           the hosts in the list. A separate thread will be created on SNBForums.com that will give specific examples on
           how to format the CURL statements in order to pull VPN Server IPs for specific countries, or cities. Please
           note that not all VPN providers make this easy, or have an API to pull information from. Examples for NordVPN,
           Surfshark, AirVPN, WeVPN and PerfectPrivacy will be provided. This item is available under the Quick Access
           Operations Menu using the (U) key.
         - MINOR: A few visual fixes here and there to standardize look & feel across screens

v0.1b    - Initial Release!
